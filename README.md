## Project Background

This project is a prototype for an educational game with the target audience of 4th-5th graders.
The goal of this prototype is for kids to learn about some of the typical school subjects in a
fun way. The game also gives students the option to make their own study set. This allows them
to study for an upcoming exam, for example.

## Project Description

FlashCars allows a maximum of 4 players to race against each other by answering questions
about a subject of their choice. Once the race starts, each user is prompted to answer questions
about their subject, and the first to make it to the end wins!

## Bibliography
To ensure FlashCars effectively aligns with key educational topics for 4th and 5th graders, the following resources were utilized.<br>
>    - [Massachusetts Department of Education](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/current.html)<br>
>    - [Common Core State Standards](https://corestandards.org/)

>    - [This image was generated with the assistance of chatGPT from OpenAI.](./images/FlashCars.jpg)
>        - Prompt: 'can you create some cool ascii art for our game readme? its called "FlashCars"'
>        - It instead provided the image above, which we edited to get rid of the words "ASCII ART."

>    - The following sources were used to create our '.gitattributes' and '.gitignore' files for our unity project. A YouTube account
>      by the name of 'Infallible Code' provided help on using Git LFS, along with knowing what files to track using LFS, add, and ignore,
>      along with a '.gitattributes' and '.gitignore' file to use to make tracking and ignoring files easier. The '.gitignore' file was
>      provided on Github that was created specifically for Unity projects. I have provided links to their YouTube channel, the exact video
>      that we watched, and the link they provided in the YouTube description that included links to download the '.gitattributes' and
>      '.gitignore' files.<br>
