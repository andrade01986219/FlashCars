## Project Background

This project is a prototype for an educational game with the target audience of 4th-5th graders.
The goal of this prototype is for kids to learn about some of the typical school subjects in a
fun way. The game also gives students the option to make their own study set. This allows them
to study for an upcoming exam, for example.

## Project Description

FlashCars allows a maximum of 4 players to race against each other by answering questions
about a subject of their choice. Once the race starts, each user is prompted to answer questions
about their subject, and the first to make it to the end wins!

## Domain Research
To ensure FlashCars effectively aligns with key educational topics for 4th and 5th graders, the following resources were utilized.<br>
